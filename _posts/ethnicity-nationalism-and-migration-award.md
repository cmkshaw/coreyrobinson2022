The paper I presented at the International Studies Association (ISA) (2018) in San Francisco, USA received the First Runner Up recipient of the Martin. O. Heisler Award, for the Best Graduate Student Paper presented at the ISA Convention on ethnicity, nationalism and/or migration. The award is sponsored by the Ethnicity, Nationalism and Migration Section (ENMISA) of the International Studies Association.

Thank you to the committee members for their consideration.
