            Corey’s research adopts an ethnographic sensibility. It uses a range of critical methodologies, including interviews with bureaucrats in the field of border enforcement and migration control in Canada, such as the Canada Border Services Agency, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Global Affairs Canada and the Office of the Special Advisor on Illegal Migration and Human Smuggling, as well as actors on the international stage like the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Additionally, Corey uses access-to-information requests and a variety of ‘grey literature’ (memos, briefing notes, internal reports and intelligence assessments) from federal agencies in Canada to gain a better understanding of the world of border enforcement and migration management, which is often hidden from researchers and the public.
            </p>
            <p>
              Corey’s Ph.D. research was funded through the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) Joseph-Armand Bombardier Canada Graduate Scholarships Program (CGS) Doctoral Scholarships and the Ontario Graduate Scholarship (OGS).
              Before coming to Durham University, Corey was a sessional instructor at York University and the University of Toronto.
